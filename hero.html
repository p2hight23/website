<p> My hero is Yuto Horigome. Yuto Horigome is the first ever Olympic gold medalist in street skateboarding. He was born in Tokyo, Japan, and picked up skateboarding when he was 7 years old. He now lives in L.A.. He's 22 years old, and his stance is goofy. He used to be #2 in the world, and Nyjah Huston used to be #1. But when the Olympics came around, Yuto surpassed Nyjah and took the #1 place.  
<p> When I first heard about skateboarding being an olympic sport, I was excited to watch it. I'm not able to watch a lot of sports since most of them bore me, but when I was watching mens street skateboarding, which was the fist skateboarding event ever to be held, my eyes were glued on the screen the whole time. It was the only sport I was able to be laser focused on, so that says a lot.  I've always wanted to learn how to skateboard, and seeing him compete at the summer olympics inspired me to finally pick up the sport. I'm half Japanese and half Amerian, so seeing Japanese representation in a sport that isn't well respected in Japan made me feel proud to be Japanese. We're not much different in age, so that is a driving factor for me to get better.
